# 1 INTRODUCTION 
In the modern world, technology is revolute and replaced by another technology generation by 
generation. Consequently, computer graphics and digital imaging are also a revolution day by 
days such as medical imaging and graphic and video applications in electronic devices. Hence the 
digital image processing and computer graphics are needed to do the image scaling that means 
resizing the image with greater than or less than the original size of the image. At that time image 
scaling techniques were created by using computer numerical analysis. Therefore, one of the 
main methods is used for image scaling is an interpolation that can be categorised as linear and 
nonlinear interpolation methods. The nearest neighbour interpolation is a linear interpolation 
method which is a low-intricacy calculation, yet it is given about enlarge image with impeding and 
associating antiquities. The best image scaling method is the bilinear interpolation method it is
implemented by considering the objective pixel that can be acquired by utilizing the linear 
interpolation in both horizontal and vertical ways. A further well-known polynomial-based 
technique is the bicubic interpolation method which utilizes visualization of the cubic model in
the 2D ordinary lattice. There are several examples of nonlinear interpolation methods such as
bilateral filter, curvature interpolation, and weighted median interpolation. Therefore using 
these numerical methods and the pixels in an image, the image can be resized within scaling 
factor. This report first part consists of the study of image scaling using nearest neighbour
interpolation, bilinear interpolation and bicubic interpolation in the first three exercises.
